Compliance tool is available (CEDA) 
nco for adding attributes: 
- atted, retains underlying engine
- ACDD-1.3 for global attrs
ncdump the raw file
ncgen for update

data (BAS convention to align with CF/ACDD): 
- units
- long name
- standard name
 
global vars (ACDD with BAS):
- title/summary could/should be generated
- history can contain lineage of model
- ack might be grant
- license == OGLv3?

CEDA do bring data (MF) for taking data 
Produce via the PDC
ORCID for creator_url

time will be the variable
calendar attribute will mark reference point (e.g. forecast_date)
standard table is your friend - match where possible, do short, long and standard names
bear in mind potential _FillValue/_missing_value (only attribute with underscores?)

pbree/apres implementation of NetCDF application of attrs
Long term PDC should ingest and output global vars from ML pipeline generally
In short term I'll apply all to output data
